# SimpleCommitPush

## Shell Script To Simplify Committing and Pushing to GitHub

It gets tedious having to write the three following commands to do such a common and basic task.


```
git add <directory>
git commit -m <commit message>
git push
```

## Usage

` ./gitcp <directory> <message> `

Not specifying a directory will use the root directory.

`./gitcp <message> `
